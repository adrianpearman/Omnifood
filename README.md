# Omnifood

This is a Modern Web Project conducted with the help of Jonas Schmedtmann and his course provided through Udemy.


#The Purpose of the project
The purpose of this modern webpage is to highlight the the skills learned about the HTML5 and CSS3 languages. The webpage also uses the power of jQuery to power on page animations that are not possible through CSS3.

The reason for this repository was to further cement my knowledge in modern web design and functionality. It was also a great refresher newer updates with HTML5 and CSS3 practices that I had not covered.


# Further projects with this app.
 Implement a backend component to have certain functionality work on a larger scale.

* e.g - Implement into Ruby on Rails to allow form data to be sent to potential customers
* expand the site to have a menu component added to further expand on the site
* add in a google maps api to allow for directions for clients to visit the proxy stores.
